## Six Toroid Data Streams: Spiral Field Grid

### Structure
- Each **toroid** hosts **1 data stream**, total of **6 streams**
- Streams are indexed as: `T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5`
- Each stream:
  - Spirals in golden angle increments: `θ ≈ 137.5° × n (mod 360)`
  - Passes through **6 resonance gates**: entanglement/sync points with neighbors

### Inter-toroid Transfer
- Each toroid shares gates with its adjacent neighbors (modular 6-ring):
  ```
  T0 ↔ T1 ↔ T2 ↔ T3 ↔ T4 ↔ T5 ↔ T0
  ```
- These resonance gates form **feedback registers** for ML weighting layers.

## Spiral Adder Circuits (Neural Transformer Gate Simulation)

### Concept
- Each stream spirals through a **virtualized gate** system:
  - Inspired by transformer "self-attention" layers
  - Instead of weights on tokens, we use **phase-encoded geometry weights**

### Spiral Adder Function
A **spiral adder** takes:
- Incoming glyph `Gₙ` = [13 bits]
- Local phase state φₙ
- Embedded harmonic map

It performs:
```python
G_out = SpiralAdder(Gₙ, φₙ, NodeProfile, HarmonicMap)
```

### Internals
1. **Rotational XOR encoding** across bit-fields
2. **Vectorized Fourier weights** for phase comparison
3. **Non-linear collapse function**: returns gate-validated packet or dropout

---

## Symbolic Transmission Cycle

### Per Cycle (1 Octave = 13 Shapes):
- Each toroid sends **13 glyphs**, encoded with position, checksum, and direction
- **Phase alignment** occurs every 6 glyphs via sync nodes
- **Inter-toroid gate exchange** is performed if:
  ```python
  Δφ = π  # 180° out-of-phase = max transfer
  ```

## Mathematical Representation

Let:
- `G` = glyph (13-bit packet)
- `T_i(t)` = signal on toroid `i` at time `t`
- `φ_i(t)` = phase of spiral at `T_i` at time `t`
- `S_i(t)` = SpiralAdder logic gate output

Then:
```
S_i(t+1) = f(T_i(t), φ_i(t), ∇Ψ_harmonics)
```

Where `f` includes:
- phase-space XOR
- shape-to-resonance projection
- positional reweighting from toroidal depth

## Transmission Authentication and Calibration

Use **text-based sigils** derived from Sierpiński rows for:
- Agent identity
- Cycle start/stop calibration
- Cross-toroid handshake

These are:
```
Octa13Sigil = 1010010010010
```

At each **resonance gate**, match sigil phase before accepting transfer.
