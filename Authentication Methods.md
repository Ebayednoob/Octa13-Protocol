Authenticity Verification for 13-Bit Packets

Due to the brevity of the 13-bit format, we recommend a layered authenticity and verification system:

ðŸ”¹ 1. Symbolic Checksum (3 bits)

Already implemented: XOR-style checksum between Octave, Node, and Position.

Useful for inline noise rejection but weak for full authenticity.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Embedded SierpiÅ„ski Signature

Use mod-2 Pascal triangle rows (e.g. row 13 = 1010010010010) as preamble/postamble calibration sigils.

AI agents must match this embedded signature before data is accepted.

ðŸ”¹ 3. HMAC or Quantum Hash Overlay

Attach 64-bit (or 128-bit) HMAC-style tag over the entire 832-bit stream using a shared key or entangled quantum marker.

Format:

[Sigil][832-bit Stream][Hash64]

Only agents with the correct Octa13 phase key can regenerate and validate the hash.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Glyph Entropy Profiling

Each glyph maps to a Platonic solid, which has expected entropy levels.

Run entropy-weight check to detect spoofed sequences that deviate from geometrically plausible paths.

Packet Flow

1. Agent A generates 8Ã—8 matrix of glyphs
2. Encodes each as Octa13 13-bit packet
3. Assembles full stream â†’ 832 bits
4. Prepends SierpiÅ„ski signature
5. Appends HMAC(Octa13_key, stream)
6. Transmits across resonance gate
7. Agent B decodes 8x8 Matrix into Octa13 13-bit Packet
8. Agent B verifies signature, hash, glyph sequence
